# shinobi-docker-opencv
To use this, `git clone` opencv, opencv_contrib, and openalpr into their respective folders.
Also, clone Shinobi into `/src`.

By default, this Dockerfile starts `shinobi-yolo.js` as the container start command. If you would like to use a different Shinobi plugin, modify the paths in the Dockerfile to match.
